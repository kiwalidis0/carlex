            <p className="article">Siopao, a popular Filipino street food, is a steamed bun with a flavorful filling that has become a beloved staple in the Philippines and beyond. Its name is derived from the Cantonese term "siu bao," which means "roast bun," highlighting its origins in Chinese cuisine. The Filipino adaptation of siopao reflects a fascinating blend of cultural influences and local tastes. Siopao is a soft, fluffy bun typically filled with a savory mixture of pork, chicken, or beef. The dough is made from a yeast-leavened batter that puffs up during steaming, creating a light and airy texture. The filling is usually cooked with a combination of soy sauce, sugar, and various spices, giving it a rich, umami flavor. While pork is the most common filling, variations can include chicken asado, beef, or even vegetarian options.</p>
